!Programming style-guide

Functions declared in header files shall have a prefix designating the file name it comes from.
	For example, the function "get_timestamp" declared in obc.h will be called "obc_get_timestamp". This is in order to prevent possible name conflicts.

An exception to the rule is task function names shall be task_<name>(void *arg)
	For example "task_adc"
